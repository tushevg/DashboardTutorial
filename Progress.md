Git:
Since Git was already installed on the raspberry pi, I started by adding a username and my e-mail adresse to git.
Then I cloned the repository "https://github.com/tushevg/DashboardTutorial.git"
I continued by looking at the files in the repository and following the tutorial on "projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-git". For Example I created this file, added it and wrote a commit.
I then created the virtual enviroment. After creating the virtual environment I tried to push the documentation file to GitHub with my Personal Access Token.
Virtual Environment:
I created a virtual environment which uses Python 3.7.3
I activated it and installed a package called "numpy" with pip. I also uninstalled it, installed an older version of it and then upgraded it to the newest version again to try out the commands.
